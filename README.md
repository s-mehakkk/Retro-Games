# Snake Game
Welcome to the Snake Game! Yes this is the classic snake game we played as kids in the tiny buttoned phones. This version is built using Pygame to make you all nostalgic. The aim remains to feed your pet snake as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake itself.

## Features
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your current score and displays it on the screen. Aim for the highest score and challenge yourself to beat your previous records!

Highscore: The game also keeps track of the highest score achieved so far. Can you beat the highscore and become the ultimate snake master?

Pause Option: Need a break? No worries! You can pause the game anytime by pressing a specific key. Take a breath, reply the guy pinging you for last 4 minutes, and resume the game whenever you're ready.

Increasing Snake Speed: As you eat more food and score points, the snake's speed gradually increases, making the game more challenging. Stay focused and keep up with the increasing pace!

Bonus Food: Watch out for bonus food that appears randomly on the screen. When eaten, it adds extra points to your score and increases the length of the snake by 3. Grab these opportunities to boost your score!

## How to Play
Use the arrow keys or on your keyboard to control the snake's movementâ€”up, down, left, and right (wasd controll also supported).

Aim to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time you eat food, your score increases.

Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. If you hit any of them, the game will end.

Try to beat your highest score and challenge yourself to improve with each playthrough.

Feel free to pause anytime you need a break.

Have fun playing the Snake Game and enjoy the classic retro gaming experience!
